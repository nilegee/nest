# Console Error Fix Summary

## Issue
User `nilezat@gmail.com` gets console error "permission denied for schema public" when trying to access profiles table, despite being whitelisted.

## Root Cause
The `get_current_user_email()` function in migration `20250116000001_fix_rls_policies.sql` has a bug:

```sql
RETURN COALESCE(
  auth.jwt() ->> 'email',
  auth.jwt() ->> 'user_email', 
  auth.jwt() ->> 'aud'  -- ❌ BUG: 'aud' is not an email field
);
```

The `auth.jwt() ->> 'aud'` fallback returns audience data (not email), causing whitelist validation to fail.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Client-side Improvements (✅ Completed)
- Enhanced error handling for code `42501` (permission denied)
- Added detailed debugging information
- Improved user experience with retry mechanism
- Clear messaging about database configuration issues

### 2. Database Fix (📋 Pending)
Created migration `supabase/migrations/20250116000002_fix_email_extraction.sql`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_current_user_email()
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Use the primary email field from JWT - this is the most reliable
  RETURN auth.jwt() ->> 'email';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

## Next Steps
1. Apply the database migration using Supabase CLI:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

2. Verify the fix by testing profile access for whitelisted users

## Verification
After applying the migration, the console should show:
- ✅ Profile loaded successfully 
- ✅ No "permission denied" errors
- ✅ Family wall loads properly
