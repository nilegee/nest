## Database & Migration Testing

### ✅ Current Migration Validation
Single migration file: `supabase/migrations/20250816000000_init_schema.sql` (397 lines)

#### Schema Verification
```sql
-- Verify all 7 tables exist with correct structure
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('families', 'profiles', 'events', 'posts', 'islamic_guidance', 'acts', 'feedback', 'notes')
ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;
```

#### RLS Policy Verification
```sql
-- Verify RLS policies are active and correct
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
ORDER BY tablename, cmd;
```

#### Email Whitelist Testing
- [ ] `public.is_whitelisted_email()` function exists
- [ ] Function correctly validates 4 authorized emails
- [ ] RLS policies use whitelist function consistently
- [ ] Client-side whitelist matches database whitelist

## Zero-Build Architecture Validation

### ✅ CDN Dependencies
- [ ] Lit 3 loads correctly from esm.sh
- [ ] Iconify web components load and render icons
- [ ] Supabase JS v2 client initializes properly
- [ ] No build step required (direct ES modules)
- [ ] Fallback CDNs work if primary fails

### ✅ Static Hosting Compatibility
- [ ] GitHub Pages deployment works correctly
- [ ] All routes work with hash-based routing
- [ ] No server-side requirements
- [ ] Service worker (if implemented) functions properly

## Browser Testing Matrix

| Browser | Login | Dashboard | Feed | Events | Status |
|---------|-------|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| Chrome | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| Firefox | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| Safari | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| Edge | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |

## Database Verification

### RLS Policy Check
```sql
-- Verify policies exist and reference correct columns
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND policyname NOT LIKE '%whitelist%'
ORDER BY tablename, cmd;
```

### Foreign Key Check  
```sql
-- Verify foreign keys reference correct columns
SELECT 
  tc.constraint_name,
  tc.table_name, 
  kcu.column_name,
  ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
  ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
  ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
  ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
AND tc.table_schema = 'public';
```

### Test Query Examples
```sql
-- These should work for authenticated family members:
SELECT family_id FROM profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
SELECT * FROM events WHERE family_id = (SELECT family_id FROM profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid());
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE family_id = (SELECT family_id FROM profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid());
SELECT * FROM islamic_guidance WHERE family_id = (SELECT family_id FROM profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid());
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:

1. **Immediate**: Revert to previous migration state
2. **Emergency**: Apply whitelist policy temporarily:
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "emergency_access" ON public.profiles
   FOR ALL USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'email' IN ('nilezat@gmail.com', ...));
   ```
3. **Investigation**: Analyze logs and identify remaining issues
4. **Fix**: Create corrective migration with proper testing
